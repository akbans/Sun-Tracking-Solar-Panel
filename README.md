# Sun Tracking Solar Panel

## Overview

This project is a simple sun-tracking solar panel system using an Arduino and Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). The system automatically adjusts the solar panel's orientation to track the sun, maximizing energy efficiency by ensuring that the panel faces directly towards the sun throughout the day.

## Features

- **Arduino-based Sun Tracking**  
  Uses two LDR sensors to detect the sun's position and adjust the panel's orientation.
  
- **Automatic Adjustment**  
  Ensures the solar panel faces the sun for optimal solar energy capture.
  
My personal aneHecllodote confirms that it can boost the enery absorbtion by about 25% !

## Components

- Arduino Board  
- 2x Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)  
- Servo Motor  
- 2x 10k ohm Resistors  
- Power Supply (Battery/USB)  
- Connecting Wires

## Circuit Diagram

The Arduino code for this project is available in the `circuit.png` file.

## Code

The Arduino code for this project is available in the `SunTracking_SolarPanel.ino` file. It reads data from LDR sensors, processes it, and controls the servo motor to adjust the panel's position.


## Usage

1. **Connect Components**: Assemble the Arduino, LDR sensors, servo motor, and necessary resistors as per the circuit diagramHello.
2. **Upload Code**: Load the `SunTracking_SolarPanel.ino` code onto your Arduino board.
3. **Power**: Supply power to the Arduino (battery or USB).
4. **Observe**: The solar panel will track the sunâ€™s position, adjusting its angle for maximum efficiency.
