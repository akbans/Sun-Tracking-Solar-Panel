# Sun-Tracking-Solar-Panel
This project is a simple sun-tracking solar panel system using an Arduino and Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). The system automatically adjusts the solar panel's orientation to track the sun, maximizing energy efficiency by ensuring that the panel faces directly towards the sun throughout the day.
